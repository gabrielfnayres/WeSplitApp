# WeSplit

WeSplit is a simple check-splitting app built using SwiftUI. It allows users to easily calculate how much each person in a group needs to pay after a meal by entering the cost of the food, selecting the tip percentage, and specifying the number of people sharing the bill. This project serves as an introduction to SwiftUI and demonstrates basic UI design, user interaction, and state management.

## Overview

WeSplit is designed to teach the basics of SwiftUI while providing a real-world example that can be expanded upon. The project is broken into three stages:


## Features

- Input for the total cost of the meal.
- Selection for tip percentage.
- Input for the number of people splitting the bill.
- Calculation of the amount each person needs to pay.

## Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1. Open Xcode and select "Create a new Xcode Project."
2. Choose the following options:
   - **iOS** > **App**
   - **Product Name**: `WeSplit`
   - **Organization Identifier**: e.g., `com.example.wesplit`
   - **Interface**: SwiftUI
   - **Language**: Swift
   - **Storage**: None
3. Click "Next," choose a location to save the project, and click "Create."
4. Open the project in Xcode and begin editing the code.

## Building the Project

The app is constructed in three stages:

### 1. Introduction to Techniques

Learn the following SwiftUI components and techniques:

- Text fields for user input.
- Pickers for selecting tip percentages.
- State variables to track changes.
- Basic layouts using VStack, HStack, and Form.

### 2. Step-by-Step Guide

Apply the techniques learned to:

- Create the main interface for the app.
- Handle user inputs dynamically.
- Calculate the amount owed per person based on the inputs.

### 3. Challenges

Expand the app by completing the following tasks:

1. Add validation for user inputs to prevent errors (e.g., negative numbers).
2. Include a currency formatter for better clarity.
3. Provide an option to round the total amount per person.
