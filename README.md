# WeSplit

WeSplit is a simple check-splitting app built using SwiftUI. It allows users to easily calculate how much each person in a group needs to pay after a meal by entering the cost of the food, selecting the tip percentage, and specifying the number of people sharing the bill. This project serves as an introduction to SwiftUI and demonstrates basic UI design, user interaction, and state management.
